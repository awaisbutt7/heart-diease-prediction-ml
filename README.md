# Heart Disease Prediction

A machine learning project to predict whether a patient has heart disease using **Logistic Regression** in Python.

## Dataset
- Source: [Heart Disease Dataset by johnsmith88 on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset)
- Target:  
  - 0 → Healthy Heart  
  - 1 → Heart Disease

## Features
The model uses patient attributes such as:
- age	sex	cp	trestbps	chol	fbs	restecg	thalach	exang	oldpeak	slope	ca	thal etc

## How It Works
1. Load and preprocess the dataset  
2. Split data into training and testing sets  
3. Train a Logistic Regression model  
4. Evaluate the model using accuracy  
5. Make predictions for new patient data
